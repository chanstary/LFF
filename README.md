To further validate the calibration effectiveness of LFF, we selected an additional set of 500 vehicle trajectories representing various vehicle types for validation purposes. We recorded a video comparing the real and simulated trajectories from Chennai, India; a screenshot is shown in Fig. 17. In the video, vehicle colors transition from red to green with increasing velocity. Different vehicle types are depicted as rectangles of various sizes and are labelled with unique identifiers (due to vertical filming, there is some vehicle overlap upstream). Since it is impractical to display all vehicles' speed and displacement characteristics in the paper, we have selected three types of vehicles—bus (No. 498), car (No. 10), and motorcycle (No. 24)—as shown in Fig. 18. Except for the abnormal deceleration upstream, likely caused by the filming angle and not accurately simulated, the overall simulation accuracy is high.
