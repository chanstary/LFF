Kanagaraj et al. (2015) amassed vehicle trajectory data on the Maraimalai Adigalar Bridge segment of the Chennai-Nagapattinam Highway in Chennai, India’s Saidapet district. This data is accessible via the link provided in their publication. The bridge, the study’s location, features six continuous lanes split between two directions. The primary traffic flow merges and diverges within a kilometer of the bridge. The data pertain to the northbound traffic and were gathered using cameras positioned on adjacent building rooftops from 2:45 to 3:15 p.m., capturing 30 minutes of vehicle trajectory information, updated every 0.5 seconds.

To further validate the calibration effectiveness of LFF, we selected an additional set of 500 vehicle trajectories representing various vehicle types for validation purposes. We recorded a video comparing the real and simulated trajectories from Chennai, India; a screenshot is shown in Fig. 17. In the video, vehicle colors transition from red to green with increasing velocity. Different vehicle types are depicted as rectangles of various sizes and are labelled with unique identifiers (due to vertical filming, there is some vehicle overlap upstream). Since it is impractical to display all vehicles' speed and displacement characteristics in the paper, we have selected three types of vehicles—bus (No. 498), car (No. 10), and motorcycle (No. 24)—as shown in Fig. 18. Except for the abnormal deceleration upstream, likely caused by the filming angle and not accurately simulated, the overall simulation accuracy is high.
